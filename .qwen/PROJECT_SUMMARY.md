# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Refactor and improve the Maliev Authentication Service to enhance code quality, testability, security, and maintainability.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: ASP.NET Core 9.0, Entity Framework Core, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication
- **Architecture**: Multi-project solution with Api, Data, JwtToken, and Tests projects
- **Key Components**: AuthenticationController, TokenGenerator, RefreshTokenDbContext, ExternalAuthenticationService
- **Development Practices**: 
  - Follow SOLID principles and separation of concerns
  - Use dependency injection and abstractions over concrete implementations
  - Maintain comprehensive unit testing with Moq
  - Apply structured logging with Serilog
- **Build Commands**: 
  - `dotnet build` for compilation
  - `dotnet test` for running tests
- **Testing**: Unit tests in Maliev.AuthService.Tests project with xUnit framework

## Recent Actions
1. [DONE] Fixed Issue #32: Refactored CleanExpiredAndRevokedTokensAsync method to remove conditional compilation directives and ensure consistent behavior across environments
2. [DONE] Fixed Issue #31: Simplified ValidateCredentials method by breaking it into smaller, focused methods for better readability and maintainability
3. [DONE] Fixed Issues #28 and #26: Refactored AuthenticationController to improve testability and centralize user validation logic by creating new services (IRefreshTokenRepository, IExternalAuthenticationService, IUserValidationService) and updating dependency injection
4. [DONE] Addressed build issues by removing obsolete test files and updating project references

## Current Plan
1. [IN PROGRESS] Working on Issue #30: Adding CancellationToken support to async methods to improve application responsiveness and prevent resource leaks
2. [TODO] Address Issue #29: Implement more specific exception types for better error handling and debugging
3. [TODO] Address Issue #20: Extract authentication logic into service layer for better separation of concerns
4. [TODO] Address Issue #27: Add more specific and structured logging for better traceability and debugging
5. [TODO] Address Issue #7: Improve Basic Authentication credential handling using ASP.NET Core built-in features
